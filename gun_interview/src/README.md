Fibonacci
The Fibonacci sequence begins like this:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
(each number is the sum of the previous two)

What is the sum of all odd numbers in the Fibonacci sequence that are less
than 10,000?

Epigram on Failure
Given the following quote by Alan Perlis

“Dealing with failure is easy: Work hard to improve. Success is also easy to
handle: You’ve solved the wrong problem. Work hard to improve.”

Considering only the alphabetical characters, consonants having the value of
their ASCII codes, and vowels having the inverse value of their ASCII codes,
what is the sum of the sentence?

Example:
Using the phrase “why and how”, w=119, h=104, y=121, d=100, n=110. A and O are vowels, so a=-97 o=-111. The sum of ‘why and how’ = 569.

Legionaries
In the range 1 - 13 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13) the digit 1
occurs 6 times.

In the range, 1 - 2,660 (half the number of Romans in a legion), expressed in
Roman numerals, how many times does the numeral “X” occur?
